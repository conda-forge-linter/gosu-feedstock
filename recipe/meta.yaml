  description: |
    This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that `su` and `sudo`
    have very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior.
    They're also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of
    `sudo`), which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if
    all you need is "run this specific application as this specific user and
    get out of the pipeline".
